# FileCompressionSystem
Compressing File Using Huffman Algorithm

The File Compression System uses Huffman Algorithm to compress the file.
It generates a dictionary which is used again for decompressing the file.

To Run the project:
Trigger the HomePage.html file and from there an user can upload a file, choose whether to compress or decompress it.
Based on the response Compression/Decompression classes will be called and File processing will happen.
Once the file processing is done, user will be redirected to download page from where the processed file can be downloaded.
For compressing/decompressing the user just needs to upload the file, the code will read the file and get the necessary data and can compress/decompress from there directly.

Future Changes:
1. As of now the project is working e2e right from user input to output.
2. The web pages designed have just few necessary fields where a lot more user friendly changes can be added.
3. The Compression system compresses/decompresses text file only as of now. So in order to compress other type of files changes needs to be done.
4. To optimize and speed up the performance of the e2e flow
